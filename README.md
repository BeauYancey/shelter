# South Utah Valley Animal Shelter Website Redesign
**UX Design Class Project — Fall 2025**

## Overview

This repository contains our redesign project for the [South Utah Valley Animal Shelter website](https://suvas.org), created for a User Experience Design course at Brigham Young University. Our goal is to improve the shelter’s online experience by making it:
- Easier to navigate for users looking to adopt, volunteer, or donate
- More visually consistent and welcoming
