    content: "Adopting a shelter pet can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. Not only do you gain a loyal companion, but you also provide a loving home to an animal in need. However, it is essential to recognize that this transition may be challenging for your new furry friend. Many shelter pets come with a history that is unknown. In this blog post, we will discuss what to expect after adopting a shelter pet, how long it may take for them to feel at home, and actionable steps you can take to help them show their true selves.\n\n"
              + "Adopting a pet from a shelter often means you won't be aware of their complete background. Many animals end up in shelters because of unknown situations. Some animals might be timid, while others may show hyperactive tendencies. It's important to recognize that your new pet might need time to adapt to their new environment.\n\n"
              + "To support your pet's transition, be patient and give them the space they need to acclimate to their environment. This will foster an atmosphere where your pet can feel secure.",

    content: "They need to be brushed and groomed! Especially our longer-haired friends. Remember to clip out a mat as soon as you notice one, they are difficult for your pet to remove on their own. Matted fur pulls on their skin and is very uncomfortable. This poor kitty's entire body was covered in mats about an inch thick. His whole back was one very large mat, you can see in the photos. It looks like we skinned him, 😂 he feels so much better now though.",
